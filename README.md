# bigamart-sales
ðŸ§¨ML project
objective: 
1. Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).
2. Build Regression models to predict the sales of the products.
3. Also evaluate the models & compare their respective scores like R2, RMSE, etc.


ðŸ“ˆData: Bigmart Sales Dataset
ðŸ“†Deadline: 30 Mordad 1402

ðŸŽˆSuggesting process:
1. Data Preprocessing (missing values, outliers,  normalizing, encoding categorical data)
2. Feature Selection (correlation analysis, feature importance, using domain knowledge) 
3. Model Selection (feel free to use any model out of scope the course, but have a reason to support why that model.)
4. Training and Evaluation (data splitting, use an appropriate evaluation metric like MSE, RMSE, or/and R2)
5. Cross Validation (Hyperparameter tuning)
6.  Interpretation and Insight (a short report in your notebook.)
